üåø Welcome to the official code and data repository for our paper:

**"A Novel Approach to Field Data Augmentation with Remote Sensing and Machine Learning in Rangelands"**

This project investigates how different sources of training data influence machine learning model performance for rangeland vegetation classification, with a focus on monitoring woody plant encroachment.

In our paper (currently under review), we compare visual interpretation and traditional field-based methods for building training datasets, and propose a hybrid approach that augments field data with neighbor pixel information. This method shows promise for improving model accuracy and reducing prediction uncertainty.

## üå± Highlights

- Explores multiple **data treatment strategies** including visual interpretation, field-based collection, and our new augmented approach
- Includes a fully reproducible **machine learning pipeline** using Random Forest optimized for ecological data
- Calculations and visualizations of **model uncertainty and class-wise performance**
- Open access to **code and data** for transparency and reuse

## üìÅ Repository Overview
This repository is organized into two main folders: `code/` and `data/`.

- The `code/` folder contains R scripts organized by task, with clear headers and comments to guide you through the recommended order of execution.
- The `data/` folder includes the complete visual interpretation dataset. This dataset can be used as-is or subsampled to explore replicate scenarios and test the effects of different sample sizes.

All visual interpretation and field data were collected by the authors during **Summer 2024**. If you use these data in your work, please cite the associated publication and acknowledge the authors' contributions.
